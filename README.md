## 📝 Description

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of Material-UI components for Streamlit, building upon the integration approach pioneered by streamlit-elements. It includes a wide range of Material-UI elements with full callback support, making it easier to create sophisticated web interfaces within Streamlit applications.
